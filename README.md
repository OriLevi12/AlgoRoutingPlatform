# AlgoRoutingPlatform

**AlgoRoutingPlatform** is an evolving platform designed to implement and compare various shortest path algorithms in graph-based systems.  
This repository currently includes the foundation of the platform, focusing on core algorithmic logic and initial testing.

## ðŸ“¦ Current Features

- Implementation of classic shortest path algorithms:
    - Dijkstra's Algorithm
    - A* Search Algorithm
- Unified interface for pathfinding logic
- Support for coordinate-based nodes and weighted edges
- Structured project layout using standard Java packages
- Comprehensive unit tests including edge cases and error handling

## ðŸš§ Work in Progress

This is **Part A** of a broader system.  
Upcoming parts will expand the platform

## âœ… How to Run Tests

Tests are written using JUnit 5. You can run them directly via IntelliJ or using:
```bash
./gradlew test  # (if Gradle is added later)
